        <p>
            Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted across the globe. From production and transport to retail and consumption, vast amounts of edible food end up in landfills instead of on plates. Food wastage not only squanders resources but also contributes to environmental pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity.
